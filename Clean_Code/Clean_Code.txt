CC|EP0002 - Names
=================

Names are not just for your convenience. They are a tool, a powerful
tool, that you can use to communicate with others. So choose your names
well and thoughtfully. Names should communicate your intent.

Create names that people can pronounce, that people can say.

The longer the scope of the variable, the longer the name of the
variable. But, variables in very short scopes should have very
short names.

Variables with short little scopes can be abbreviated down even just to
one letter.

Variable names should be short, even one letter, if they're in a tiny
little scope. But variable names should be long if they're in a big long
scope.

So remember, variables that have long scopes should have long names.

Oddly enough, functions and classes follow the opposite rule. That
longer the scope, the shorter the function or class name should be.

Functions that are called from many places, and have big long scopes,
should have nice, short, convenient names.

On the other hand, functions that have long, highly visible scopes,
should have short, convenient names, whereas functions that are private,
they've got short little scopes, should have long, explanatory names.

And the same goes for classes. Classes that have long, highly-visible
scopes should have nice, short, convenient names. Private classes that
are buried inside of a tiny little scope, well, they can have long,
explanatory names.

And then watch out for those derived classes, because they've got long
scopes, but you start adding adjectives to them, and they can get longer
and longer. So be careful of that.

Give classes, noun names. Give variables nouns. Give methods verb names.
If they're Booleans, make them predicates.

Functions follow the opposite rule. Function names should be short if
they've got a long scope. Function names should be long and descriptive,
if they have a short scope.

And the same rule goes for classes. Nice, short names for public
classes. Longer names for private classes in tiny scopes.

CC|EP0003 - Functions
=====================

The first rule of functions: they should be small. The second rule of
functions: they should be smaller than that.

Four lines is OK, maybe five. Six, OK. 10 is way too big.

A function should do one thing, it should do it well, and it should do
it only.

And all functions have well-chosen, highly descriptive names, that
tell you what the function does.

And functions in a small scope should have long, descriptive names.


You continue to extract functions until you cannot extract any more,
than the runction do one thing.
